I used this project to test paystack API

Having to build an e-commerce site has always been something
i wanted to do, and thanks to paystack. this was done without
any trouble and less complications.

1) I used bootstrap's cdn to serve the style sheet.
2) I created a paystack starter business account and then
   used my live key for the inline popup pay method
3) Images from www.unsplash.com

viola, that's all what it takes.

THANK YOU
